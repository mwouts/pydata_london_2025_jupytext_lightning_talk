## Jupyter notebooks

Notebooks are amazing for research! And tutorials ðŸ˜‰

<br>

The `.ipynb` format (JSON) may be a bit verbose but overall it is simple, robust and well documented.

<br>

Jupytext: edit^[or store, convert, synchronize etc.] your notebooks as `.py` files^[many more formats are available, including `.md`]

## Text notebooks

Content is almost what you typed!

```python
# %% [markdown]
# This is a markdown cell

# %%
def f(x):
  return 3*x+1
```

<br>

::: {.callout-tip}
- Text notebooks can have metadata (but no outputs)
- Markdown cells can be either commented text or multiline strings
:::

## Why text notebooks?

- Well suited for version control
- Edit and run your notebooks in your IDE
- Turn your notebooks into libraries
- Quality assurance: `pre-commit`, `ruff`, typing etc. just work

::: {.callout-tip}
Text only notebooks are a good fit for

- docs (use the MyST Markdown format)
- and for tutorials (use the `py:percent` format)
:::

## Paired notebooks (edit in Jupyter)

In general you want _paired_ notebooks. A paired notebook is made of two files:

- `notebook.ipynb` is your usual notebook
- `notebook.py` is the text version

<br>

Open either file in Jupyter (they are the same document).

Both files get updated when you save the notebook.

## Paired notebooks (edit in IDE)

Open `notebook.py` in your IDE and edit it. Then re-open the notebook in Jupyter (or reload it), and you will see the edits! 

<br>

Input cells are loaded from the `.py` script

Output cells are loaded from the `.ipynb` file.

<br>

::: {.callout-tip}
To force the synchronization outside of Jupyter, use either `jupytext --sync`,
our pre-commit hook, or the community-maintained plugins for VIM and VS Code
:::

## Installation

- `pip install jupytext` or <br>`conda install jupytext -c conda-forge`
- Restart your Jupyter server

<br>

Now `.py` and `.md` files have a notebook icon, and you get a Jupytext sub-menu in Jupyter ðŸŽ‰

## Creating paired notebooks

Pair one notebook using the Jupytext Menu:

Pair all notebooks in the current and child folders with a `jupytext.toml` file 
containing e.g. `formats="ipynb,py"`

## Creating text notebooks 

Create text only notebooks with the _New Text Notebook_ menu.

Open existing text notebooks with a right click^[run `jupytext-config set-default-viewer python markdown` to open `.py` and `.md` files as notebooks by default]
